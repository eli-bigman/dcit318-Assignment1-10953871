The assignment includes three C# console applications that perform different tasks: a grade calculator, a ticket price calculator, and a triangle type identifier. Each program is selected from a main menu and can be run repeatedly or exited to return to the main menu.

## Description
The assignment is a C# console application that allows the user to select from three different programs:

1. **Grade Calculator**: Converts a numerical grade to a letter grade.
2. **Ticket Price Calculator**: Calculates the price of a movie ticket based on age.
3. **Triangle Type Identifier**: Determines the type of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides.

## Programs

### Grade Calculator
This program prompts the user to enter a numerical grade between 0 and 100. Based on the entered grade, it displays the corresponding letter grade using the following scale:
- 90 and above: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F

### Ticket Price Calculator
This program prompts the user to enter their age. Based on the entered age, it calculates the ticket price:
- Standard price: GHC10
- Discounted price (for children 12 and under, and seniors 65 and older): GHC7

### Triangle Type Identifier
This program prompts the user to enter the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. It then determines and displays the type of the triangle:
- Equilateral: All three sides are equal.
- Isosceles: Two sides are equal.
- Scalene: No sides are equal.
